# Melanoma Detection
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
	Multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 
- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
	CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma
- What is the dataset that is being used?
	The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
	Model is overfitting (training accuracy much higher than validation accuracy) and struggling with high validation loss.
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
	Overfitting have reduces in new model as compared to previous one.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysi
	After using Augmentor and adding 500 images per class, accuracy of the model have improved and now there is no under-fitting/overfitting.
